# NixOps

[![Test](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/actions)

_NixOps_ is a tool for deploying [NixOS](https://nixos.org) machines in a network or cloud. Key features include:

- **Declarative**: NixOps determines and carries out actions necessary to realise a deployment configuration.
- **Testable**: Try your deployments on [VirtualBox](https://github.com/nix-community/nixops-vbox) or [libvirtd](https://github.com/nix-community/nixops-libvirtd).
- **Multi Cloud Support**: Currently supports deployments to [AWS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops-aws), [Hetzner](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops-hetzner) and [GCE](https://github.com/AmineChikhaoui/nixops-gce)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Deployment descriptions are divided into _logical_ and _physical_ aspects. This makes it easy to separate parts that say _what_ a machine should do from _where_ they should do it.
- **Extensible**: _NixOps_ is extensible through a plugin infrastructure which can be used to provide additional backends.

For more information please refer to the [NixOps manual](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/).

### Running

_NixOps_ is included in nixpkgs and can be executed in a shell as follows:

enter a shell suitable for working on _NixOps_ which will contain all Python dependencies specified in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml)

```
$ nix-shell
