Release notes
=============

Release 2.0
-----------

- Removed NixOS Options

  - ``deployment.autoLuks.*`` - moved to `nixos-modules-contrib`_.
  - ``deployment.autoRaid0.*`` - moved to `nixos-modules-contrib`_.

- Notable Files Removed

  - ``nix/adhoc-cloud-vm.nix`` (`#1303`_, `#1312`_) - the included behavior was
    not targeted to any specific use case or generic to support all
    cloud VMs.


  - ``nix/auto-luks.nix`` (`#1297`_, `#1312`_) - the module is now
    nixos-modules-contrib_, since its behavior was not specific to
    NixOps, and outside of the core feature set of NixOps.

  - ``nix/auto-raid0.nix`` (`#1299`_, `#1312`_) - the module is now
    nixos-modules-contrib_, since its behavior was not specific to
    NixOps, and outside of the core feature set of NixOps.

  - ``nixops/data/nixos-infect`` (`#1305`_, `#1312`_) - plugins needing
    nixos-infect should include it themselves.

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.3:

Release 1.3 (September 28, 2015)
--------------------------------

-  General

   -  NixOps now requires NixOS 14.12 and up.

   -  Machines in NixOps network now have access to the deployment name,
      uuid and its arguments, by means of the ``deployment.name``,

      use: ``nixops create '<nixops/templates/container.nix>'``.

   -  Support ``username@machine`` for ``nixops scp``

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.2:

Release 1.2 (April 30, 2014)
----------------------------

-  General

   -  NixOps now requires NixOS 13.10 and up.

   -  Add ``--all`` option to ``nixops destroy``,
      ``nixops delete`` and ``nixops ssh-for-each``.

   -  The ``-d`` option now matches based on prefix for convenience when
      the specified uuid/id is not found.

   -  Resources can now be accessed via direct reference, i.e. you can
      use ``securityGroups = [ resources.ec2SecurityGroups.foo ];`` in
      stead of
      ``securityGroups = [ resources.ec2SecurityGroups.foo.name ];``.

   -  Changed default value of ``deployment.storeKeysOnMachine`` to
      false, which is the more secure option. This can prevent
      unattended reboot from finishing, as keys will need to be pushed
      to the machine.

-  Amazon EC2

   -  Support provisioning of elastic IP addresses.

   -  Support provisioning of EC2 security groups.

   -  Support all HVM instance types.

   -  Support ``ap-southeast-1`` region.

   -  Better handling of errors in pushing Route53 records.

   -  Support using ARN's for applying instance profiles to EC2
      instances. This allows cross-account API access.

   -  Base HVM image was updated to allow using all emphemeral devices.

   -  Instance ID is now available in nix through the
      ``deployment.ec2.instanceId`` option, set by nixops.

   -  Support independent provisioning of EBS volumes. Previously, EBS
      volumes could only be created as part of an EC2 instance, meaning
      their lifetime was tied to the instance and they could not be
      managed separately. Now they can be provisioned independently,
      e.g.:

      ::

               resources.ebsVolumes.bigdata =
                 { name = "My Big Fat Data";
                   region = "eu-west-1";
                   zone = "eu-west-1a";
                   accessKeyId = "...";
                   size = 1000;
                 };


   -  To allow cross-account API access, the
      ``deployment.ec2.instanceProfile`` option can now be set to either a
      name (previous behaviour) or an Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the
      instance profile you want to apply.

-  Hetzner

   -  Always hard reset on destroying machine.

   -  Support for Hetzner vServers.

   -  Disabled root password by default.

   -  Fix hard reset for rebooting to rescue mode.. This is particularly
      useful if you have a dead server and want to put it in rescue
      mode. Now it's possible to do that simply by running:

      ::

               nixops reboot --hard --rescue --include=deadmachine


-  VirtualBox

   -  Require VirtualBox >= 4.3.0.

   -  Support for shared folders in VirtualBox. You can mount host
      folder on the guest by setting the
      deployment.virtualbox.sharedFolders option.

   -  Allow destroy if the VM is gone already

This release has contributions from aszlig, Corey O'Connor, Domen Kožar,
Eelco Dolstra, Michael Stone, Oliver Charles, Rickard Nilsson, Rob
Vermaas, Shea Levy and Vladimir Kirillov.

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.1.1:

Release 1.1.1 (October 2, 2013)
-------------------------------

This a minor bugfix release.

-  Added a command-line option ``--include-keys`` to allow importing SSH
   public host keys, of the machines that will be imported, to the
   ``.ssh/known_hosts`` of the user.

-  Fixed a bug that prevented switching the
   ``deployment.storeKeysOnMachine`` option value.

-  On non-EC2 systems, NixOps will generate ECDSA SSH host key pairs
   instead of DSA from now on.

-  VirtualBox deployments use generated SSH host key pairs.

-  For all machines which nixops generates an SSH host key pair for, it
   will add the SSH public host key to the known_hosts configuration of
   all machines in the network.

-  For EC2 deployments, if the nixops expression specifies a set of
   security groups for a machine that is different from the security
   groups applied to the existing machine, it will produce a warning
   that the change cannot be made.

-  For EC2 deployments, disks that are not supposed to be attached to
   the machine are detached only after system activation has been
   completed. Previously this was done before, but that could lead to
   volumes not being able to detach without needing to stop the machine.

-  Added a command-line option ``--repair`` as a convient way to pass this
   option, which allows repairing of broken or changed paths in the nix
   store, to nix-build calls that nixops performs. Note that this option
   only works in nix setups that run without the nix daemon.

This release has contributions from aszlig, Ricardo Correia, Eelco
Dolstra, Rob Vermaas.

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.1:

Release 1.1 (September 9, 2013)
-------------------------------

-  Backend for `Hetzner <http://hetzner.de>`__, a German data center
   provider. More information and a demo video can be found
   `here <https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/pull/119>`__.

-  When using the ``deployment.keys.*`` options, the keys in ``/run/keys``
   are now created with mode 600.

-  Fixed bug where EBS snapshots name tag was overridden by the instance
   name tag.

-  The nixops executable now has the default OpenSSH from nixpkgs in its
   PATH now by default, to work around issues with left-over SSH master
   connections on older version of OpenSSH, such as the version that is
   installed by default on CentOS.

-  A new resource type has been introduced to generate sets of SSH
   public/private keys.

-  Support for spot instances in the EC2 backend. By specifying the
   ``deployment.ec2.spotInstancePrice`` option for a machine, you can
   set the spot instance price in cents. NixOps will wait 10 minutes for
   a spot instance to be fulfilled, if not, then it will error out for
   that machine.

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.0.1:

Release 1.0.1 (July 11, 2013)
-----------------------------

This is a minor bugfix release.

-  Reduce parallelism for running EC2 backups, to prevent hammering the
   AWS API in case of many disks.

-  Propagate the instance tags to the EBS volumes (except for Name tag,
   which is overridden with a detailed description of the volume and its
   use).

.. _ssec-relnotes-1.0:

Release 1.0 (June 18, 2013)
