# Dummy module necessary to allow the manual to be generated.  The EC2
# module extends the fileSystems option, so we need a type/description
# for that option.  But providing it in the EC2 module would cause an
# error because multiple definitions of the type/description are not
# allowed.  So this module, which defines them, is included only for
# the generation of the manual.
