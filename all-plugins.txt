# Nixops all-plugins.txt file
#
#
# Description:
# ------------
#
#  * This file defines which github organizations, owners and repositories
#    contain nixops plugins.  Currently, it is configured for the
#    nixos github organization and the respective nixops plugin repos
#    that exist there.
#
#  * These definitions are used by the update-all script to
#    generate a nix expression in data.nix containing accurate
#    nixops plugin repo information.
#
#  * See the README.md file for how to build nixops with any of
#    the nixops plugins specified here and in the data.nix file.
#
#  * Each nixops plugin repo added is required to have a github release
#    tag in order to be found by the update-all script.  By convention
#    and for compatibility with current script processing, this is a
#    tag that starts with a 'v', followed by the version, such as: v1.0.0
#
# The accepted format for defining nixops plugin repos is one
# of two forms:
#
#  1) Define the github organization:
#       * Optionally provide a grep repo filtering expression
#       * Optionally provide a grep repo negative filtering expression
#       * grep expressions need to be backslash escaped as appropriate
#       * See the grep manual for formatting, `man grep` or visit:
#         https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html
#       * Repositories that are not part of an organization
#         will need to use the second form below.
#
#  Pattern:
#  <organization>      [grep-expression]         [grep-v-expression]
#
#
#  Example: A github org with only nixops plugin repos, all
#           of which are desired.
#  Note:    This will break unless the org has only nixops-plugin
#           repos.
#
#  org-with-only-plugins
#
#
#  Example: The nixos org with a grep filter for all 'nixops-' repos.
#  Note:    This will break since there are some nixops-.* repos which
#           are not actually nixops plugin repos (ie: nixops-dashboard).
#
#  nixos               nixops-
#
#
#  Example: The nixos org with a grep filter for all 'nixops-' repos
#           and a negative grep filter for one undesired repo.
#
#  nixos               nixops-                     nixops-dashboard
#
#
#  Example: The nixos org with just two specific nixops plugin repos
#           matched by grep filter.
#
#  nixos               nixops-\(aws\|hetzner\)
#
#
#  2) Define the github organization or github owner along with specific
#     repository in the following form, one repository per line:
#       * <github_org|github_owner>/repo
#
#
#  Example: Include the nixos nixops-aws repo.
#
#  nixos/nixops-aws
#
#
#  Example: Include the nixos nixops-hetzner repo.
#
#  nixos/nixops-hetzner
#
#
#  CONFIGURATION FOLLOWS:
#  ----------------------

nixos/nixops-aws
nixos/nixops-hetzner
